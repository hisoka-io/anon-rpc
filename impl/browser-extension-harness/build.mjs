// Builds the package's three execution contexts plus the files an extension
// copies into its own package:
//
//   dist/background.js                        ESM — imported by the service worker
//   dist/offscreen.js                         ESM — imported by an offscreen document
//   dist/static/anon-rpc/<stamp>/offscreen.{html,js}  — a ready-made offscreen document
//   dist/static/anon-rpc/<stamp>/sandbox.{html,js}    — the §6 sandboxed page
//
// The install step copies the whole `anon-rpc` directory into an extension, so
// the files land together rather than loose among the extension's own pages.
//
// ## Why the assets sit in a version-stamped directory
//
// `background.js` is imported from node_modules and rebuilt by the
// integrator's bundler, so it tracks the installed version automatically. The
// two static files are COPIES, and copies do not update themselves. They are
// the far half of a protocol whose near half is in background.js, so an
// upgrade that re-bundles one and not the other pairs mismatched halves — and
// the symptom is not an error: `mount.ts` ignores messages it does not
// recognise and nothing on the boot path has a timeout, so `worker.ready`
// simply never settles.
//
// Stamping the version into the PATH removes the failure mode rather than
// reporting it. background.js resolves `anon-rpc/<stamp>/offscreen.html` from
// its own build, so a stale copy is not a subtly wrong file, it is a missing
// one — and assets.ts turns that into a sentence naming the fix.
//
// The stamp is `<package version>-<8 hex of the asset bytes>`. A content hash
// rather than a commit sha because a published tarball carries no git context
// and a sha lies on a dirty tree, and because the bytes are what has to match.
// The version is in front so a human can read the directory.
//
// The integrator's manifest does NOT need updating per version: `sandbox.pages`
// honours wildcards, so `anon-rpc/*/sandbox.html` is written once. That is
// measured, not assumed — see probe/sandbox-glob.mjs.
//
// The two library entries keep npm dependencies external so consumers dedupe
// them. The two STATIC bundles do not: they are copied into an extension
// package and loaded by URL, where nothing resolves node_modules.
//
// sandbox.js is not built here at all — it is copied verbatim from the
// browser harness's own `dist/iframe-boot.js`. That is deliberate: the
// sandboxed page must run exactly the code the harness's `srcdoc` path runs,
// because the host half on the other side of the postMessage is identical. A
// re-bundle could drift; a copy cannot.
